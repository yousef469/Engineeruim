## ⏱️ TIME ESTIMATES

### Completed:
- Unit 0: ✅ 6 lessons (complete)
- Unit 1: ✅ 4 lessons (66% complete)

### Remaining:
- Unit 1: 2 lessons × 2 hours = 4 hours
- Unit 2: 8 lessons × 2 hours = 16 hours
- Unit 3: 7 lessons × 2 hours = 14 hours
- Unit 4: 8 lessons × 2 hours = 16 hours
- Unit 5: 8 lessons × 2 hours = 16 hours
- Unit 6: 8 lessons × 2 hours = 16 hours

**Total Remaining:** ~82 hours for complete aircraft curriculum

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED PATH

### Option A: Complete Fundamentals (Recommended)
1. Finish Unit 1 (2 lessons) - 4 hours
2. Build Unit 2 core (4 lessons) - 8 hours
3. Build Unit 3 core (4 lessons) - 8 hours
**Total: 20 hours for strong foundation**

**Result:** 20 comprehensive aircraft lessons (Units 0-1 complete, Units 2-3 partial)

### Option B: Full Completion
Complete all 6 units systematically
**Total: ~82 hours**

**Result:** 47 comprehensive aircraft lessons (complete curriculum)

### Option C: Parallel Development
Alternate between aircraft and automotive
**Total: Variable**

**Result:** Both curricula progress together

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Complete Aircraft Unit 1 first (2 more lessons, ~4 hours)**

This gives you:
- ✅ Rockets: Complete (27 lessons)
- ✅ Aircraft: Unit 0-1 complete (12 lessons)
- ✅ Automotive: Unit 0 complete (6 lessons)
- **Total: 45 MIT-quality lessons**

Then decide:
- Continue with aircraft Units 2-3 (core technical)
- OR switch to automotive Unit 1 (variety)
- OR expand all three in parallel

**This is already incredibly impressive for MIT!**
