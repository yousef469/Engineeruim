# Plan to Enhance Geometry Lessons (Unit 2)

## Current Status
Unit 2 has basic versions of lessons 6-11. They work but are hard to understand.

## What Needs Enhancement

### Lesson 6: 2D Geometry ✅ (Keep as is - it's simple enough)
- Basic shapes, areas, perimeters
- Already has good examples

### Lesson 7: 3D Coordinates ⚠️ NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
**Current:** Basic explanation of (x, y, z)
**Enhanced version ready with:**
- ASCII art showing coordinate systems
- "Walking through space" step-by-step
- GPS/building analogies
- Drone delivery examples
- Visual distance formula breakdown

### Lesson 8: Trigonometry ⚠️ NEEDS ENHANCEMENT  
**Current:** Basic SOH-CAH-TOA
**Enhanced version ready with:**
- Labeled triangle diagrams
- Clock analogies for angles
- Step-by-step rocket tracking
- Multiple worked examples
- Visual representations

### Lesson 9: Vectors ⚠️ NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
**Current:** Basic vector operations
**Enhanced version ready with:**
- Arrow visualizations
- Force diagrams
- Robot movement examples
- Tip-to-tail addition visuals
- Drone hovering challenge

### Lesson 10: Dot & Cross Product ⚠️ NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
**Current:** Basic formulas
**Enhanced version ready with:**
- Perpendicularity visual explanation
- Torque with wrench diagrams
- Work calculation examples
- Robot gripper design challenge
- Step-by-step breakdowns

### Lesson 11: Rotations ⚠️ NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
**Current:** Basic rotation formulas
**Enhanced version ready with:**
- Clock hand analogies
- Point rotation visualizations
- Robot arm examples
- Matrix multiplication explained
- Interactive rotation challenges

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Keep lesson 6 as is (simple enough)
2. Replace lessons 7-11 with enhanced versions
3. Test in the app
4. Get user feedback

## Enhanced Features Include:
- 3x more content per lesson
- ASCII art diagrams
- "Step 1, Step 2..." format
- Real-world analogies
- Multiple practice problems
- Interactive challenges
- Visual explanations

## File to Update:
`src/data/mathematics/unit2-geometry.js`

The enhanced content is ready - just need to integrate it!
