**Real Examples:**
- Raptor engine: 290 s (SL), 361 s (Vac)
- LH₂ vs RP-1: 53% fuel savings but 5.4× larger tanks
- Ion thruster: 2,884 s (10× chemical rockets)

**Content Highlights:**
- ✅ Why staging is necessary (mathematical proof)
- ✅ Multi-stage rocket equation
- ✅ Optimal staging strategy (equal mass ratios)
- ✅ Stage separation mechanics
- ✅ Falcon 9 and Saturn V analysis

**Key Equations:**
- Δv_total = Σ v_e,i × ln(R_i) (Multi-stage)
- R_opt = √[n](R_total) (Optimal staging)
- Separation velocity from momentum conservation

**Real Examples:**
- Falcon 9: Stage 1 R=19.5, Stage 2 R=22.8
- Saturn V: Three stages with R=16.9, 12.6, 9.0
- Starship: Hot staging innovation

### Lesson 10: Thrust-to-Weight Ratio & Acceleration Analysis
**Duration:** 25 min | **Level:** Beginner

**Content Highlights:**
- ✅ TWR requirements for different missions
- ✅ Time-varying TWR during flight
- ✅ Gravity losses and optimization
- ✅ Max-Q and throttling strategies
- ✅ Structural limits and acceleration control

**Key Equations:**
- TWR(t) = T/[m(t)·g] (Time-varying)
- Δv_gravity = g·t_burn (Gravity loss)
- a(t) = g×(TWR(t) - 1) (Acceleration)

**Real Examples:**
- Falcon 9: TWR grows from 1.41 to 30.3 during burn
- Throttling to limit acceleration to 3-4g
- Max-Q throttling at T+80s

**Key Concepts:**
- Solid: Simple, reliable, but no throttle (I_sp: 250-280s)
- Liquid: High performance, complex (I_sp: 300-465s)
- Gas generator: 95% efficient, simple
- Staged combustion: 99% efficient, complex
