## 🎯 Why "Unit 0: Foundations"?

### Perfect Name Because:
1. **Comes before Unit 1** - Students start here
2. **Foundation** - Builds the base for deep content
3. **Bridge** - Connects math/physics to engineering
4. **Self-contained** - Can be taken independently
5. **Prerequisite** - Prepares for advanced topics

### Student Experience:
```
Option A: Traditional Path
Math/Physics → Unit 0: Foundations → Unit 1+ (Deep Content)

Option B: Jump In Path
Unit 0: Foundations → "I need calculus!" → Math Units → Back to Unit 0 → Unit 1+

Both work! Unit 0 shows what math/physics is needed.
```
