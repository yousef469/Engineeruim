      intro: '🚀 Motion is everywhere in engineering - from cars on highways to rockets in space. But what IS motion? Motion is a change in position of an object with time. Here\'s the key insight: motion only makes sense relative to something else (a reference point). Even when you feel still, you\'re moving with Earth at 1,670 km/h! Understanding motion is the foundation of all mechanical engineering.',

        {
          title: '🧠 1. The Concept of Motion (Core Idea)',
          explanation: 'Motion means an object\'s position changes over time. But motion is RELATIVE - it depends on what you compare yourself to. If your position changes relative to a reference point → you\'re in motion. If not → you\'re at rest (relative to that frame). Key insight: There\'s no absolute rest in the universe - only motion relative to something. Even sitting "still," you\'re moving with Earth (1,670 km/h rotation + 107,000 km/h around Sun)!',
          example: 'You\'re on a plane flying at 900 km/h. Relative to the plane, you\'re at rest (0 km/h). Relative to the ground, you\'re moving at 900 km/h. Relative to another plane flying beside you, you\'re at rest again! Same situation, different motion - it all depends on your reference frame.'

          title: '📍 2. Position & Displacement',
          explanation: 'POSITION is where you are at any moment (like coordinates on a map: x, y, z). DISPLACEMENT is the straight-line distance from where you started to where you ended up (with direction). Your PATH is the actual route you took. Key insight: You can travel a long path but have zero displacement if you return to start!',
          example: 'Walking around a city block: Start at corner A, walk 100m north to B, 100m east to C, 100m south to D, 100m west back to A. Your PATH = 400m (walked all 4 sides). Your DISPLACEMENT = 0m (ended where you started - straight line from start to end is zero). Your POSITION changed constantly (A→B→C→D→A) but final displacement is zero!'

          title: '🛣️ 3. Distance vs Displacement',
          explanation: 'DISTANCE = total path length (scalar - just a number, always positive). DISPLACEMENT = straight line from start to end (vector - has direction, can be zero). Think of it this way: Distance tells you "how much ground you covered." Displacement tells you "how far you are from where you started." Distance can never decrease, but displacement can be zero even after traveling far!',
          example: 'Race car example: Drive 5 km north, then 5 km south back to start. DISTANCE = 10 km (you drove 5+5). DISPLACEMENT = 0 km (you ended at the starting point). After 100 laps on a 5 km circular track: Distance = 500 km (total driven), Displacement = 0 km (back at start).

          description: 'Artillery shells follow projectile paths. Howitzer: adjustable angle for different ranges. 45° gives max range on flat ground. For targets on hills, adjust angle. Modern artillery computers solve projectile equations accounting for: launch angle, muzzle velocity, air resistance, wind, Earth rotation (Coriolis). Precision requires understanding projectile physics!'
