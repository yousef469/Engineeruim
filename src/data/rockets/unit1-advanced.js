    introduction: "🎯 Specific Impulse (Isp) is like 'miles per gallon' for rockets! It measures how efficiently an engine uses propellant. Higher Isp = better efficiency = less fuel needed. Chemical rockets: 300-450s. Ion engines: 3,000+ seconds. This 10× difference revolutionizes deep space missions!",

        title: "🧠 What is Specific Impulse?",
        content: "**Definition:** Specific Impulse (Isp) is the thrust produced per unit weight of propellant consumed per second.\n\n**Units:** Seconds (yes, really!)\n\n**Formula:** Isp = v_e / g₀\n\nWhere:\n• v_e = exhaust velocity (m/s)\n• g₀ = 9.81 m/s² (standard gravity)\n\n**Alternative Formula:** Isp = T / (ṁ × g₀)\n\nWhere:\n• T = thrust (N)\n• ṁ = mass flow rate (kg/s)\n\n**Physical Meaning:**\nIsp tells you: 'For how many seconds can this engine produce thrust equal to the weight of propellant it consumes?'\n\n**Example:**\nIsp = 300 seconds means:\n• 1 kg of propellant produces 9.81 N of thrust for 300 seconds\n• OR produces 2,943 N for 1 second\n• Total impulse = 2,943 N·s per kg\n\n**Why Seconds?**\nHistorical convention from early rocketry. Makes comparison easy:\n• Higher number = better efficiency\n• Independent of units (metric/imperial)\n• Easy to remember typical values\n\n**Typical Values:**\n• Cold gas thrusters: 50-70 s\n• Solid rockets: 250-280 s\n• Kerosene/LOX (sea level): 300-310 s\n• Kerosene/LOX (vacuum): 340-360 s\n• Hydrogen/LOX (vacuum): 430-465 s\n• Ion engines: 3,000-10,000 s\n• Nuclear thermal: 800-1,000 s\n\n**Example: Merlin 1D Specific Impulse**\n\n**Given:**\n• Exhaust velocity: v_e = 3,050 m/s (sea level)\n• Standard gravity: g₀ = 9.81 m/s²\n\n**Calculate Isp:**\nIsp = v_e / g₀ = 3,050 / 9.81 = 311 seconds\n\n**In vacuum:**\n• v_e = 3,310 m/s\n• Isp = 3,310 / 9.81 = 337 seconds\n\n**Interpretation:**\n• 1 kg of propellant produces thrust for 311 seconds\n• Total impulse = 311 × 9.81 = 3,050 N·s per kg\n• Vacuum Isp is 8% higher (better expansion)\n\n**Why Isp Matters:**\nA 10% increase in Isp can reduce fuel mass by 20-30% for the same mission!\n\n**Example:**\nMission requiring 6,000 m/s delta-v with 1,000 kg payload:\n\n**Engine A: Isp = 300s (v_e = 2,943 m/s)**\nR = e^(6,000/2,943) = 8.17\nm₀ = 1,000 × 8.17 = 8,170 kg\nFuel = 7,170 kg\n\n**Engine B: Isp = 330s (v_e = 3,237 m/s)**\nR = e^(6,000/3,237) = 6.05\nm₀ = 1,000 × 6.05 = 6,050 kg\nFuel = 5,050 kg\n\n**Result:** 10% Isp increase → 30% less fuel!"

          question: "Why is staging necessary for orbital flight?",

            "To increase thrust",
            "To drop empty tanks (dead weight), improving mass ratio for remaining stages",

            "For safety"
          ],
          correctAnswer: 1,
          explanation: "Staging drops empty tanks and engines that are dead weight. This dramatically improves the mass ratio for remaining stages. Without staging, single-stage-to-orbit is nearly impossible!"

          options: [
            "Multiply the Δv of each stage",
            "Add the Δv of each stage: Δv_total = Δv₁ + Δv₂ + Δv₃",

          correctAnswer: 1,
          explanation: "Multi-stage Δv is additive! Δv_total = Δv₁ + Δv₂ + Δv₃. Each stage adds its delta-v to the total."

          correctAnswer: 1,
          explanation: "For staging, mass ratios multiply: R_eff = R₁ × R₂ = 6 × 4 = 24. This is why staging is so powerful - you get the benefit of multiplied mass ratios!"
