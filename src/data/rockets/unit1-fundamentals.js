    unit: "Rocket Fundamentals",
    duration: "25 min",
    introduction: "Understanding how rockets generate thrust is fundamental to all rocket engineering. Unlike jet engines that use atmospheric air, rockets carry both fuel and oxidizer, making them the only propulsion system that works in the vacuum of space.",
