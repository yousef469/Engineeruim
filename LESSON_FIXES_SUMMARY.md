# 🔧 LESSON SYSTEM FIXES - SUMMARY

## ✅ PROBLEMS FIXED

### **1. Unit 0 "Lesson Not Found" Error**
**Problem:** Unit 0 lessons used string IDs ("0.1", "0.2", "0.3") but the lesson page expected numeric IDs
**Solution:** Convert Unit 0 IDs to numeric (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) during import
**Impact:** All Unit 0 Foundation lessons now work correctly

### **2. Low-Quality Generated Lessons**
**Problem:** Lessons 28+ were auto-generated placeholders with minimal content
**Solution:** Removed all generated lessons; only MIT-quality content remains
**Impact:** No more confusing "template" lessons

### **3. Incorrect Lesson Counts**
**Problem:** UI showed "80 lessons" but only 28 were real
**Solution:** Updated all counts to reflect actual content
**Impact:** Accurate expectations for users

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### **For Complete Automotive Curriculum:**
Need 17 more lessons to reach 28 (match rockets):
- 3 more in Vehicle Dynamics
- 4 more in Powertrain
- 4 more in Chassis
- 6 in new units (Systems, Design)

### **Estimated Time:**
- 17 lessons × 2 hours = 34 hours
- At current pace: 2-3 days
