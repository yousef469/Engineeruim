## 🚀 QUICK START APPROACH

### Option A: Depth-First
Complete one discipline fully:
1. Finish all aircraft units
2. Then do automotive
3. Ensures one complete curriculum

### Option B: Breadth-First
Build Unit 1 for both:
1. Aircraft Unit 1 (6 lessons)
2. Automotive Unit 1 (8 lessons)
3. Then expand both
4. Provides variety

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)
Core units for both, then expand:
1. Aircraft Units 1-2 (14 lessons)
2. Automotive Units 1-2 (16 lessons)
3. Strong foundation in both
4. Can expand later
