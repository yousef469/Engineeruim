## Is 28 Lessons Enough?

### ✅ YES - Here's Why:

**1. Focused Scope**
- We cover ROCKETS specifically
- Not diluted with planes, spacecraft, etc.
- Deep dive into rocket engineering

**2. Appropriate Depth**
- More than Coursera intro courses
- Less than MIT graduate courses
- Perfect for self-learners and undergrads

**3. Efficient Learning**
- Each lesson is dense with content
- 30-50 minutes of focused material
- No fluff or repetition

**4. Complete Coverage**
- All major rocket topics covered
- From basics to advanced
- Theory + practical examples

**5. Real-World Focus**
- Falcon 9, Starship, Saturn V examples
- Modern SpaceX innovations
- Industry-relevant content

### Comparison to Similar Courses:

**Khan Academy - Physics:**
- ~40 lessons for ALL of mechanics
- We have 28 for just rockets (appropriate)

**MIT OCW 16.50 (Intro to Propulsion):**
- 13 lectures for semester course
- We have 28 lessons (more comprehensive)

**Coursera Specializations:**
- Typically 4-6 courses × 4-6 weeks each
- Each week = 1-2 hours
- Total: 16-36 hours
- We're at 20-25 hours (comparable)

## What We Could Add (Optional Expansion)

If you want to expand to 40-50 lessons, here are topics:

### Advanced Topics (12 more lessons):

**Unit 6: Advanced Propulsion (4 lessons)**
- Electric propulsion (ion drives)
- Nuclear thermal rockets
- Advanced concepts (VASIMR, fusion)
- Future technologies

**Unit 7: Mission Design (4 lessons)**
- Launch vehicle selection
- Trajectory optimization
- Multi-body dynamics
- Interplanetary missions

**Unit 8: Testing & Operations (4 lessons)**
- Ground testing
- Flight testing
- Launch operations
- Failure analysis

### But This Would:
- Increase to 40 lessons (~30 hours)
- Move toward MIT graduate level
- Risk overwhelming beginners
- Dilute focus on core concepts

## Conclusion

**28 lessons is PERFECT for:**
- Self-learners interested in rockets
- Undergrad aerospace students
- Career changers to aerospace
- SpaceX/Blue Origin interview prep
- Solid foundation before graduate school

**It's NOT meant to replace:**
- 4-year aerospace engineering degree
- MIT graduate propulsion course
- Professional engineering training

**Our sweet spot:**
```
High school physics → Our 28 lessons → MIT graduate courses
                      ↑
                   Perfect entry point
                   to rocket engineering
```

**Verdict: 28 lessons is the right amount!** 🚀

We're more comprehensive than intro courses, more accessible than graduate courses, and perfectly positioned for motivated learners who want to understand rocket engineering deeply.
